# First Day in College
I enjoyed my first day in college which was orientaion day.On that day I Reaced college by 9 AM early morning and went to college's gurdwara sahib and heared kirtan shabad organized by our college ,then outside the gurdwara sahib there was treat for students after  we went to college auditorium where principle welcomed students of btech first year and told us about college rules and regulations.All of us heared these instructions carefully and then many other professors shared their experiences of life and life during study time and guided us about future and success. I were really motivated with this and on that day i learnt many new thing for future.I will never forget My first day in college.This day is really memorable for me.
